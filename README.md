## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://github.com/Copycord/Copycord/blob/main/docs/Instructions.md)
- Discord Account Token + Discord Bot Token

### Setup

1. **Prepare the clone server**  
   Create a new Discord server to receive mirrored content and house your bot.

2. **Obtain your user token**

   - Log into Discord in a browser with your account.
   - Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
   - Enable device emulation mode (Ctrl+Shift+M), then paste the code below into the console and press Enter:
     ```js
     const iframe = document.createElement('iframe')
     console.log(
       'Token: %c%s',
       'font-size:16px;',
       JSON.parse(
         document.body.appendChild(iframe).contentWindow.localStorage.token
       )
     )
     iframe.remove()
     ```
   - Copy and store this token securely.

3. **Create and configure the bot**
   - In the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), create a new bot.
   - Under **Installation**, set the Install Link to `None` and click save.
   - Under **Bot**, click reset token and store your bot token somewhere secure, disable `Public Bot`, and enable these intents:
     - `Presence`
     - `Server Members`
     - `Message Content`
   - Under **OAuth2**, generate an invite url with (Scopes: `bot`, Bot Permissions: `Administrator`) and invite the bot to your clone server.

## Configuration

### 1. Create a copycord folder and add docker-compose.yml

```
copycord/
├── docker-compose.yml # docker compose file
└── data/ # data folder will be created automatically
```

`docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  admin:
    image: copycord-local:latest
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: code/dockerfile
    container_name: copycord-admin
    environment:
      - ROLE=admin
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  server:
    image: copycord-local:latest
    pull_policy: never
    container_name: copycord-server
    environment:
      - ROLE=server
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    depends_on:
      - admin
    restart: unless-stopped

  client:
    image: copycord-local:latest
    pull_policy: never
    container_name: copycord-client
    environment:
      - ROLE=client
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    depends_on:
      - admin
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!NOTE]
> Docker Compose will build the local image automatically the first time you run the stack. If you need to rebuild after making code changes, re-run `docker compose up --build -d` to refresh the containers. To keep using the published registry image instead, swap each `image` back to `ghcr.io/copycord/copycord:<tag>` and remove the `build` / `pull_policy` lines.

### 2. Launch Copycord

Make sure you have Docker & Docker Compose installed, then open a command prompt in the same directory and run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

If you're using the legacy Docker Compose binary, replace `docker compose` with `docker-compose`.

This will build (or rebuild) the local image and start the web UI: http://localhost:8080

### 2. Configure Copycord via the web ui
